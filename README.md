Overview:

The Ask Me Anything application is an interactive Streamlit app that integrates with the LangChain framework and the ChatGroq API to generate intelligent responses for user queries. It leverages advanced AI language models to provide real-time, contextual, and relevant answers.

Features:

Simple UI: User-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

AI-Powered: Uses the ChatGroq model for high-quality responses.

Interactive Input: Users can input their queries and get instant answers.

Efficient API Handling: Integrates securely with the ChatGroq API via an API key.


Requirements

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or above
An active Groq API key (replace with your own API key in the script)

Libraries:
streamlit
langchain_groq
os
time

Installation

Clone the repository
Install dependencies
  pip install streamlit langchain_groq
  Set up the environment: Replace the placeholder GROQ_API_KEY in the script with your actual API key or set it as an evironment variable.

How to Run

Run the application:
streamlit run app.py
Open the app in your web browser. By default, it will be available at:
http://localhost:8501
Type your query in the input field and press Ask to get a response.

Code Explanation
The app uses Streamlit for UI, LangChain's ChatGroq for model interaction, and os for environment variable handling. The key is set in the environment variables for secure API communication. The ChatGroq class is instantiated with the llama3-8b-8192 model for generating responses. The st.text_input widget captures user input, and st.button triggers the query-processing logic. The response from the AI model is displayed using st.write.
